# TDI_Capstone_Proposal_Fall_2022
I am interested in exploring the connections between economic factors and violent uprisings which occur worldwide. Factors which lead to precarity-- low unemployment rate, low wages, low production, and high inequality place an enormous amount of stress on populations which may motivate these populations to revolt against institutions of authority. An additional detail I would like to examine is whether countries with especially dire economic conditions are more likely to use excessive force against people in time of uprising, or if rich countries with large military and police budgets are the most violent towards protestors.
